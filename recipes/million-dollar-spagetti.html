        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground Italian sausage or pork sausage</li>
        <li>salt and pepper , to taste</li>
        <li>1 small onion , chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic , minced</li>
        <li>24 ounces marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese , softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese or ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Steps:</em></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven</strong> to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet cook and crumble the ground beef and Italian sausage and season with salt and pepper. Remove most of the grease. Add onions and garlic and cook for a few minutes until onion is translucent. Add all but ½ cup of the marinara sauce (reserve ½ cup for later) to the mixture and stir to combine. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare noodles:</strong> Cook Spaghetti according to package instructions, just until “al dente”. Drain, and place hot spaghetti in a large mixing bowl with butter and ½ cup reserved marinara sauce and toss to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Cheese layer:</strong> Combine cream cheese, sour cream and cottage cheese in a bowl and mix well. Smooth over noodles in the pan. </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Pour HALF of the pasta into a 9×13’’ pan. Smooth cheese layer on top. Top with remaining noodles. Add meat sauce on top and smooth into an even layer. Top with mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 30-40 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Check it around 20 minutes and if the cheese is browning too quickly, tent a piece of tinfoil over it. Wait at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving, to allow it to set up. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
